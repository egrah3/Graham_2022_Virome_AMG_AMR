__ABSTRACT__

The human skin is the first barrier against pathogens and consists of a diverse microbiome that provides protective functions. Studies have demonstrated that bacteriophages modulate bacterial community composition and facilitate the transfer of host-specific genes, potentially influencing host cellular functions. However, little is known about the human skin virome and its role in human health. Expressly, how viral-host relationships influence skin microbiome structure and function is poorly understood. To address this, population dynamics and genetic diversity of bacteriophage communities were evaluated in viral metagenomic data collected from three anatomical skin locations from 60 subjects at five different time points collected over 6-months. We found that cutaneous bacteriophage populations are mainly composed of tailed Caudovirales phages that carry auxiliary genes to help improve host fitness through metabolic processes and antimicrobial resistance. Sequence variation in the MRSA-associated AMR gene, erm(C), was evaluated through targeted sequencing to identify host selection of antimicrobial genes. This large temporal study of human skin-associated viruses indicates that the human skin virome is associated with auxiliary metabolic genes and AMR genes to help increase host fitness.
